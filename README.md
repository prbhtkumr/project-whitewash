# 🕵️ Project WHITEWASH (The "Official" Epstein List Generator)

"Transparency you can't see through."

## 📄 Overview

Are you a government agency tired of manually blacking out incriminating documents with a Sharpie? Project WHITEWASH is here to automate the obfuscation process.

This Python script leverages advanced reportlab technology to programmatically generate 97 pages of pure, unadulterated redaction. It features state-of-the-art random block generation to simulate "national security interests" and strategically sprinkles the word "Epstein" just enough to keep conspiracy theorists busy for months.

## ✨ Features

Dynamic Redaction Engine™: Uses advanced RNG (Random Non-disclosure Generation) to create black blocks of varying lengths. No two cover-ups are alike!

Bureaucratic Realism: Includes a "RELEASED PER FOIA REQUEST" stamp that is slightly rotated and faded to simulate maximum administrative apathy.

Watermark Enforcement: Automatically stamps every page with a high-visibility "CLASSIFIED" watermark.

"Intentionally Blank" Logic: Randomly inserts blank pages to frustrate anyone trying to print it.

Legacy Scan Simulation: Uses Courier font and dark grey text to mimic a document that has been faxed, scanned, printed, and scanned again.

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed and the ability to keep a secret.
```bash
pip install reportlab
```

### ⚙️Generating the Files

Run the script to generate your own highly classified document:
```bash
python whitewash-generator.py
```

The script will output `epstein_list_release_final_v2_DO_NOT_OPEN.pdf`.

### 🛠️ Configuration

You can tweak the "Transparency Level" inside the script:

`mention_probability = 0.02`: Just enough transparency to be legally distinct from a black rectangle.

`total_pages = 97`: Increase to 500 to crash a browser's PDF previewer.
